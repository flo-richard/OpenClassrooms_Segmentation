In the exploration notebook, we first clean the data and aggregate all data files, explore and feature engineer data.

In the model notebook, we test different clustering algorithms (K-means, DBSCAN), with different features features and with different numbers of clusters for the K-means algorithm.

In the maintenance notebook, we find the optimal frequency at which the segmentation mus tbe updated to remain relevant.
